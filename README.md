# alexa-empower-skill


This project was made for PearlHacks 2018 held at UNC. 

We developed an Alexa skill that young women can utilize to feel empowered if they ever feel demotivated.
It gives voice to the many female leaders in technology to give the users role models to look up to,
thus easily inspiring them to continue working for their dreams.

This Alexa skill was published to Amazon.
